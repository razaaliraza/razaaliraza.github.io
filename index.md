I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.bu.edu/cs/) at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu). I joined CS@BU in Fall’17. 
<br />
<br />

At BU, I am working with [Prof. Orran Krieger](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/orran-krieger/). My area of interest is Operating Systems, specifically turning the Linux kernel into a unikernel.
